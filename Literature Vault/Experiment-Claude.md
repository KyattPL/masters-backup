1. **Randomizing the Murderer for the AI Version**:
   - Keeping the murderer constant across both versions (AI and non-AI) would be preferable for a more controlled experiment.
   - Randomizing the murderer in the AI version could introduce additional variables that might complicate the analysis and make it harder to attribute differences to the incorporation of the LLM.
   - If you decide to randomize the murderer, you should consider having multiple sub-groups for the AI version, with each sub-group having a different murderer. This would help account for potential differences caused by the identity of the murderer.

2. **Testing the Two Versions**:
   - Your proposed A/B testing approach with counterbalancing (some participants starting with version A, others with version B) is a good way to account for potential order effects.
   - However, instead of having participants switch between versions in the middle of the game, it might be better to have them complete one version entirely before moving to the other. This would provide a more immersive and consistent experience within each version.
   - You could consider randomly assigning participants to two groups: Group 1 plays the non-AI version first, followed by the AI version, and Group 2 plays the AI version first, followed by the non-AI version.
   - Additionally, you could include a washout period (e.g., a few days or a week) between playing the two versions to minimize potential carryover effects.

3. **Measures and Data Collection**:
   - Decide on the specific measures you want to assess for your thesis, such as immersion, engagement, narrative coherence, or player satisfaction.
   - Develop appropriate questionnaires or rating scales to capture these measures after each version of the game.
   - You could also consider conducting post-game interviews or focus groups to gather qualitative feedback from participants.
   - Collect demographic data (e.g., age, gender, gaming experience) to account for potential confounding variables.

4. **Sample Size and Power Analysis**:
   - Determine an appropriate sample size based on a power analysis, considering the expected effect size, desired statistical power, and significance level.
   - A larger sample size would increase the statistical power and reliability of your findings.

5. **Ethical Considerations**:
   - Obtain necessary approvals from your institution's ethics review board or committee, if applicable.
   - Ensure informed consent from participants and protect their privacy and confidentiality.
   - Provide debriefing information about the experiment's purpose and goals after data collection.
