If you do not want to conduct a pilot study and cannot estimate the expected effect size, a common approach is to use a conservative or medium effect size estimate for the power analysis.

Assuming a desired statistical power of 0.8 and a significance level (α) of 0.05, we can calculate the required sample size for a medium effect size (d = 0.5) using a two-tailed independent samples t-test, since your study involves two independent groups (predefined dialogue vs. LLM-enabled dialogue).

Using an online sample size calculator (e.g., https://www.danielsoper.com/statcalc/calculator.aspx?id=48) or statistical software like G*Power, the required total sample size for a medium effect size (d = 0.5), power of 0.8, and α = 0.05 in a two-tailed independent samples t-test is:

N = 128 (64 participants per group)

This means that to have an 80% chance of detecting a medium effect size difference in engagement/immersion between the two conditions, you would need a total sample size of 128 participants, with 64 participants in each group (predefined dialogue and LLM-enabled dialogue).

It's important to note that this sample size calculation assumes a medium effect size, which may be an overestimate or underestimate of the true effect size in your study. If the actual effect size is smaller than 0.5, you may need a larger sample size to achieve adequate power. Conversely, if the effect size is larger than 0.5, you may be able to get away with a smaller sample size.

Additionally, this calculation assumes equal group sizes. If you anticipate or plan for unequal group sizes, the required total sample size may need to be adjusted accordingly.

In summary, based on the assumptions of a desired power of 0.8, a significance level of 0.05, and a medium effect size (d = 0.5), a total sample size of 128 participants (64 per group) would be required for your experiment comparing engagement/immersion between the predefined dialogue and LLM-enabled dialogue conditions. However, it's always a good practice to consider conducting a pilot study to obtain a more accurate estimate of the effect size, which can then be used to refine the sample size calculation for the main study.
