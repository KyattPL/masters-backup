Title: [Survey] Thesis survey about video game narrative
alt: Video game engagement based on dialogue system

Hi, I'm looking for people willing to play a visual novel game and answer some questions about the experience. The study is a part of a Computer Science thesis.

Here's the deal:
💻 It's all online through a Google Form
⏰ Takes around 30-40 minutes total
📝 You answer some basic questions about yourself
🎮 Play through a visual novel game, make choices
🔂 Play it again with slightly different scenarios
✍️ Give feedback after each playthrough

What's a visual novel? It's a game where you read text and your choices change the story. Basically, it's like an interactive book/comic with visuals.

Anyone who can read in English is welcome! You don't need prior experience with these types of games.

The survey is totally anonymous.
