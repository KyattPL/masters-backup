Hi, I'm looking for people willing to play a visual novel game and answer some questions about the experience. If you do mine, I can do your survey!

Here's the deal:
💻 It's all online through a Google Form
⏰ Takes around 30-40 minutes total
📝 You answer some basic questions about yourself
🎮 Play through a visual novel game, make choices
🔂 Play it again with slightly different scenarios
✍️ Give feedback after each playthrough

Anyone who can read in English is welcome! You don't need prior experience with these types of games.

The survey is totally anonymous.
