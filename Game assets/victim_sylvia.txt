Victim (Sylvia):

Core Description:
Sylvia was a young and beautiful heiress, who had everything she ever wanted - except happiness. She lived in a luxurious mansion on the outskirts of the city, surrounded by servants and admirers, but isolated from genuine affection. She was bored of her shallow and superficial lifestyle, and longed for something more meaningful and exciting. She secretly dreamed of becoming a detective, solving mysteries and catching criminals, just like her favorite novels. She even had a collection of disguises and gadgets that she used to sneak out of the house and explore the city at night.

One day, she received an invitation to a mysterious party at a remote castle, hosted by a mysterious benefactor. She saw this as an opportunity to escape her dull routine and experience a real adventure. She packed her suitcase with her detective tools and some elegant dresses, and boarded the train to the castle. She hoped to meet some interesting people, maybe even find love, and perhaps uncover a secret or two. She did not know that this would be her last journey, and that she would become the victim of a sinister plot. She did not know that someone at the party had a motive to kill her, and that someone else had the means to do it. She did not know that her death would spark a series of events that would reveal the dark secrets of the castle and its guests. She did not know that her life was about to end, but her story was about to begin.
