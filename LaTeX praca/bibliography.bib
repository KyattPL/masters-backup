  abstract  = {Much research on artificial intelligence in games has been devoted to creating opponents that play competently against human players. We argue that the traditional goal of AI in games-to win the game-is but one of several interesting goals to pursue. We promote the alternative goal of making the human player's play experience ``better,'' i.e., AI systems in games should reason about how to deliver the best possible experience within the context of the game. The key insight we offer is that approaching AI reasoning for games as ``storytelling reasoning'' makes this goal much more attainable. We present a framework for creating interactive narratives for entertainment purposes based on a type of agent called an experience manager. An experience manager is an intelligent computer agent that manipulates a virtual world to dynamically adapt the narrative content the player experiences, based on his or her actions and inferences about his or her preferred style of play. Following a theoretical perspective on game AI as a form of storytelling, we discuss the implications of such a perspective in the context of several AI technological approaches.},

  abstract  = {In a traditional role-playing game (RPG) conversing with a Non-Playable Character (NPC) typically appears somewhat unrealistic and can break immersion and user engagement. In commercial games, the player usually selects one of several possible predefined conversation options which are displayed as text or labels on the screen, to progress the conversation. In contrast, we first present a spoken conversational interface, built using a state-of-the-art open-domain social conversational AI developed for the Amazon Alexa Challenge, which was modified for use in a video game. This system is designed to keep users engaged in the conversation -- which we measure by time taken speaking with the character. In particular, we use emotion detection and emotional dialogue management to enhance the conversational experience. We then evaluate the contribution of emotion detection and conversational responses in a spoken dialogue system for a role-playing video game. In order to do this, two prototypes of the same game were created: one system using sentiment analysis and emotional modelling and the other system that does not detect or react to emotions. Both systems use a spoken conversational AI system where the user can freely talk to a Non-Playable-Character using unconstrained speech input.},

Reporting about the work of a European flagship project on serious game technologies, it presents a set of advanced game AI components that enable pedagogical affordances and that can be easily reused across a wide diversity of game engines and game platforms. Serious game AI functionalities include player modelling (real-time facial emotion recognition, automated difficulty adaptation, stealth assessment), natural language processing (sentiment analysis and essay scoring on free texts), and believable non-playing characters (emotional and socio-cultural, non-verbal bodily motion, and lip-synchronised speech), respectively. The reuse of these components enables game developers to develop high quality serious games at reduced costs and in shorter periods of time. All these components are open source software and can be freely downloaded from the newly launched portal at gamecomponents.eu. The components come with detailed installation manuals and tutorial videos. All components have been applied and validated in serious games that were tested with real end-users.},

A range of traditional and emerging narrative techniques are considered, including The Hero’s Journey, three-act structure, the portrayal of human emotions, and character archetypes, from where an in-depth examination of interactive narrative is performed on a range of old and modern games. Initial results pertaining to the time allocated to narrative, the use of back stories, cut scenes, on-screen text, prompts, and game structure are also presented, which reveal a distinct level of uniformity of how interactive narrative is depicted in games spanning over two decades of industry development. The analysis is concluded in the second article, where further results are revealed to help uncover the precise nature of game narratives. }

  abstract = {ChatGPT’s release and general availability has the potential to create new possibilities for storytelling in games. There are potential benefits of leveraging ChatGPT to generate a narrative at runtime in a video game, as well as possible resulting pitfalls. To explore these factors, we created a game prototype that dynamically instantiates game assets from JSON, generated by ChatGPT. We additionally incorporate a dynamic status-effect system and, in conjunction with textual player input, utilise this in order to instruct ChatGPT to generate an informed narrative as the game is played. Player feedback indicates that ChatGPT’s addition is beneficial overall, though not without some downsides.}

  abstractnote = {A vast number of game developers long for and seek to create games that impact and emotionally engages their players. However, it has proven to be a tough challenge to overcome, as a lot of narrative games today completely separate their emotional stories from their engaging gameplay.Extending this insight, this paper proposes the theoretical basis intendedto contribute to the understanding of how to create expressive AI agents, by answering the following question: __How can developers tell stories through an AI agent’s behaviour?__A further key element in this paper is the creation of a conceptual framework, based on a literature study, exemplifying how AI agents can be designed to contribute and support the narrative in a game.The framework suggests that creating these types of AI agents is an iterative process of defining the core themes within a game, deriving an agent’s purpose from these and building its behaviours from that purpose. Also, defining how to communicate these behaviours to the player. The framework also emphasizes the importance of user testing during the design process, as a way of evaluating the balance of transparency and emergence within the AI system of the game.The framework is exemplified with a case study conducted on an AI agent, designed and developed for the game __Shelter 2: Paws__ by game studio Might and Delight. The results of the study shows that AI agent has a close connection to the narrative through the main themes of friendship, cooperation and growing up in the game. Finally, the AI agent design is evaluated through user tests, which shows that players interact with the agent as expected and share the game experience that is intended by the developers.},

  abstract = {Deep engagement in video game-playing has the potential to be to be one important determinant of the impact of playing violent video games, but there are currently no reliable measures of this subjective experience. To fill this gap, the Game Engagement Questionnaire (GEQ) was developed using both classical and Rasch analyses. In Study 1 Rasch analyses provide support for the reliability and functionality of the GEQ scores. Rasch analyses also demonstrate that the GEQ has adequate separation, fit, rating scale functioning, and dimensionality, suggesting that one’s tendency to become engaged in video game-playing is a quantifiable construct. In Study 2, behavioral and questionnaire data supported the reliability and validity of the GEQ for predicting engagement in violent video games. The GEQ provides a psychometrically strong measure of levels of engagement specifically elicited while playing video games, and thus shows promise for future research examining risk and protective factors for negative game impact.}

In the context of video game-play, a revised UES (UESz) demonstrated better psychometric properties than the original UES defined by six subscales, including enhanced reliability. Further validity analysis included comparisons with the Flow State Scale (FSS), showing the complementary nature of the two scales and what constructs both scales might be measuring in a video game context. Criterion validity analysis demonstrated that UESz was more predictive of game performance than the FSS. Findings related to both the UESz and FSS were discussed relative to an overarching framework of hedonic and utilitarian qualities of game-play.}

Regression results revealed motivational engagement for gaming was related to gender, hours of play, task orientation, and socialization. Players indicated that gaming was socially captivating, fun, challenging but relaxing, and precipitated positive affect and cognition even when unsuccessful results were achieved. The negative consequences normally associated with task failure were not reported by participants to take place during gaming.

  abstract  = {This document contains the English version of the Game Experience Questionnaire. The development and testing of the Game Experience Questionnaire is described in project Deliverable 3.3. The Game Experience Questionnaire has a modular structure and consists of :1. The core questionnaire2. The Social Presence Module3. The Post-game module.In addition to these modules, a concise in-game version of the GEQ was developed.All three modules are meant to be administered immediately after the game-session has finished, in the order given above. Part one and two probe the players{\textquoteright} feelings and thoughts while playing the game; Part 3, the post-game module, assesses how players felt after they had stopped playing.Part 1 is the core part of the GEQ. It assesses game experience as scores on seven components: Immersion, Flow, Competence, Positive and Negative Affect, Tension, and Challenge. For a robust measure, we need five items per component. As translation of questionnaire items, no matter how carefully performed, sometimes results in suboptimal scoring patterns, we have added a spare item to all components. After the first use of the translated GEQs, scale analyses will be performed to check whether any item should be discarded or replaced.Part 2, the social presence module, investigates psychological and behavioural involvement of the player with other social entities, be they virtual (i.e., in-game characters), mediated (e.g., others playing online), or co-located. This module should only be administered when at least one of these types of co-players were involved in the game.Part 3, the post-game module, assesses how players felt after they had stopped playing. This is a relevant module for assessing naturalistic gaming (i.e., when gamers have voluntarily decided to play), but may also be relevant in experimental research.The In-game version of the GEQ is a concise version of the core questionnaire. It has an identical component structure and consists of items selected from this module. The in-game questionnaire is developed for assessing game experience at multiple intervals during a game session, or play-back session. This should facilitate the validation of continuous and real-time indicators some of the partners in the FUGA project are developing.},

  abstract = {Accurate measurement of the player experience in videogames is key to understanding the impacts of videogame play, designing and developing engaging videogames, and effectively applying game design principles in other fields. A large number of player experience questionnaires are available, but in most cases empirical validation of the scales is limited or absent. Two of the most commonly used scales are the Player Experience of Need Satisfaction (PENS) and the Game Experience Questionnaire (GEQ). Both scales were developed using a rational-theoretical approach, but neither scale has had formal factor-analytic studies published, limiting our capacity to judge the empirical validity of the scales. We present detailed exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of both scales based on responses from a sample (n = 571) of videogame players. The GEQ is partially supported (using a revised factor structure); the PENS is largely supported (with a more minor revision of the factor structure). We provide suggestions for the most effective use of both scales in future research.}

We employed SPSS 22.0 for exploratory factor analysis using study 1 respondents to explore the factors for consumer videogame engagement and reliability analysis. Results of EFA resulted with six-factor solution. We further used SmartPLS 3.0 software on study 2 respondents to further confirm the six-factor solution as reflective measurement model on the first-order level, and three second-order formative constructs on the second-order or higher-order level as formative measurement model. Results of the reflective measurement model and formative measurement model evidenced that consumer videogame engagement has strong psychometric properties and is a valid instrument to measure engagement in videogame play. Results also confirmed that consumer videogame engagement is a multidimensional construct as well as a reflective-formative construct. The study is unique in its investigation as it develops an instrument to measure engagement in videogame play which comprises the cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions.},
