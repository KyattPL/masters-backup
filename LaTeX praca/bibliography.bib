  abstract  = {Much research on artificial intelligence in games has been devoted to creating opponents that play competently against human players. We argue that the traditional goal of AI in games-to win the game-is but one of several interesting goals to pursue. We promote the alternative goal of making the human player's play experience ``better,'' i.e., AI systems in games should reason about how to deliver the best possible experience within the context of the game. The key insight we offer is that approaching AI reasoning for games as ``storytelling reasoning'' makes this goal much more attainable. We present a framework for creating interactive narratives for entertainment purposes based on a type of agent called an experience manager. An experience manager is an intelligent computer agent that manipulates a virtual world to dynamically adapt the narrative content the player experiences, based on his or her actions and inferences about his or her preferred style of play. Following a theoretical perspective on game AI as a form of storytelling, we discuss the implications of such a perspective in the context of several AI technological approaches.},

  abstract  = {In a traditional role-playing game (RPG) conversing with a Non-Playable Character (NPC) typically appears somewhat unrealistic and can break immersion and user engagement. In commercial games, the player usually selects one of several possible predefined conversation options which are displayed as text or labels on the screen, to progress the conversation. In contrast, we first present a spoken conversational interface, built using a state-of-the-art open-domain social conversational AI developed for the Amazon Alexa Challenge, which was modified for use in a video game. This system is designed to keep users engaged in the conversation -- which we measure by time taken speaking with the character. In particular, we use emotion detection and emotional dialogue management to enhance the conversational experience. We then evaluate the contribution of emotion detection and conversational responses in a spoken dialogue system for a role-playing video game. In order to do this, two prototypes of the same game were created: one system using sentiment analysis and emotional modelling and the other system that does not detect or react to emotions. Both systems use a spoken conversational AI system where the user can freely talk to a Non-Playable-Character using unconstrained speech input.},

Reporting about the work of a European flagship project on serious game technologies, it presents a set of advanced game AI components that enable pedagogical affordances and that can be easily reused across a wide diversity of game engines and game platforms. Serious game AI functionalities include player modelling (real-time facial emotion recognition, automated difficulty adaptation, stealth assessment), natural language processing (sentiment analysis and essay scoring on free texts), and believable non-playing characters (emotional and socio-cultural, non-verbal bodily motion, and lip-synchronised speech), respectively. The reuse of these components enables game developers to develop high quality serious games at reduced costs and in shorter periods of time. All these components are open source software and can be freely downloaded from the newly launched portal at gamecomponents.eu. The components come with detailed installation manuals and tutorial videos. All components have been applied and validated in serious games that were tested with real end-users.},

  abstract = { This essay is the first of a two-part article examining the use of narrative in computer and video games, which provides an overview and discussion of the definitions and representation of stories, plots, and narratives. A range of traditional and emerging narrative techniques are considered, including The Hero’s Journey, three-act structure, the portrayal of human emotions, and character archetypes, from where an in-depth examination of interactive narrative is performed on a range of old and modern games. Initial results pertaining to the time allocated to narrative, the use of back stories, cut scenes, on-screen text, prompts, and game structure are also presented, which reveal a distinct level of uniformity of how interactive narrative is depicted in games spanning over two decades of industry development. The analysis is concluded in the second article, where further results are revealed to help uncover the precise nature of game narratives. }

  abstract = {ChatGPT’s release and general availability has the potential to create new possibilities for storytelling in games. There are potential benefits of leveraging ChatGPT to generate a narrative at runtime in a video game, as well as possible resulting pitfalls. To explore these factors, we created a game prototype that dynamically instantiates game assets from JSON, generated by ChatGPT. We additionally incorporate a dynamic status-effect system and, in conjunction with textual player input, utilise this in order to instruct ChatGPT to generate an informed narrative as the game is played. Player feedback indicates that ChatGPT’s addition is beneficial overall, though not without some downsides.}

Based on identity foundation in symbolic interactionism, we take gamer and learner identities as meaning structures with both dynamic and stable dimensions. The basis of this gamer identity perspective is identity has a crucial role in investigating learning. Applying a life history approach, we interviewed 10 participants in one-to-one interviews, with three interviews for each participant. Applying the narrative portrait, we analysed participant data. We found that gamer identity construction from video game playing, as a vital meaning structure, has four main aspects, namely in-game identification, social community expansion, restorative effect and meaning recognition, providing gamers with expansive ways to build learner and personal identity as that can benefit their formal education.&lt;/p&#38;gt;},

  abstractnote = {A vast number of game developers long for and seek to create games that impact and emotionally engages their players. However, it has proven to be a tough challenge to overcome, as a lot of narrative games today completely separate their emotional stories from their engaging gameplay.Extending this insight, this paper proposes the theoretical basis intendedto contribute to the understanding of how to create expressive AI agents, by answering the following question: __How can developers tell stories through an AI agent’s behaviour?__A further key element in this paper is the creation of a conceptual framework, based on a literature study, exemplifying how AI agents can be designed to contribute and support the narrative in a game.The framework suggests that creating these types of AI agents is an iterative process of defining the core themes within a game, deriving an agent’s purpose from these and building its behaviours from that purpose. Also, defining how to communicate these behaviours to the player. The framework also emphasizes the importance of user testing during the design process, as a way of evaluating the balance of transparency and emergence within the AI system of the game.The framework is exemplified with a case study conducted on an AI agent, designed and developed for the game __Shelter 2: Paws__ by game studio Might and Delight. The results of the study shows that AI agent has a close connection to the narrative through the main themes of friendship, cooperation and growing up in the game. Finally, the AI agent design is evaluated through user tests, which shows that players interact with the agent as expected and share the game experience that is intended by the developers.},

  abstract = {As video games evolve, the role of artificial intelligence also referred to as AI has been essential. Games have come a long way from being small and having rudimentary logic to being extremely complex and narrative-driven. This research paper will dive into the vast history of AI in gaming, following its path from the simple ball-paddle mechanics of Pong, to the intricate entanglements presented in modern games such as Fortnite, Call of Duty, League of Legends, and more. The interplay between game design and AI development doesn’t just show how far we have come in technological advancement, but rather it shows our creative evolution. Who would've thought 50 years ago, you’d be able to play games with players across the world at the same time? What can we expect in the next 50 years as AI continues to develop?},

In this context, player behavioural modelling is concerned with two goals, namely (1) providing an interesting or effective game AI on the basis of player models and (2) creating a basis for game developers to personalise gameplay as a whole, and creating new user-driven game mechanics. In this article, we provide an overview of player behavioural modelling for video games by detailing four distinct approaches, namely (1) modelling player actions, (2) modelling player tactics, (3) modelling player strategies, and (4) player profiling. We conclude the article with an analysis on the applicability of the approaches for the domain of video games.}

To fill this gap, the Game Engagement Questionnaire (GEQ) was developed using both classical and Rasch analyses. In Study 1 Rasch analyses provide support for the reliability and functionality of the GEQ scores. Rasch analyses also demonstrate that the GEQ has adequate separation, fit, rating scale functioning, and dimensionality, suggesting that one’s tendency to become engaged in video game-playing is a quantifiable construct. In Study 2, behavioral and questionnaire data supported the reliability and validity of the GEQ for predicting engagement in violent video games. The GEQ provides a psychometrically strong measure of levels of engagement specifically elicited while playing video games, and thus shows promise for future research examining risk and protective factors for negative game impact.}

Exploratory factor analysis revealed four factors (Focused Attention, Perceived Usability, Aesthetics, and Satisfaction) as compared to the six found in the original development of the UES. In the context of video game-play, a revised UES (UESz) demonstrated better psychometric properties than the original UES defined by six subscales, including enhanced reliability. Further validity analysis included comparisons with the Flow State Scale (FSS), showing the complementary nature of the two scales and what constructs both scales might be measuring in a video game context. Criterion validity analysis demonstrated that UESz was more predictive of game performance than the FSS. Findings related to both the UESz and FSS were discussed relative to an overarching framework of hedonic and utilitarian qualities of game-play.}
