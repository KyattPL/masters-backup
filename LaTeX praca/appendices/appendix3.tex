    \textbf{How did you feel interacting with NPCs?}                                                                     & \textbf{How interested were you in talking to NPCs?}                                                                            & \textbf{Did you enjoy talking to NPCs?} & \textbf{Other thoughts}                                                                                                                                                                                                    \\ \hline
    It felt like reading a novel. The game left no room for my own decisions when talking to the NPC's.                  & I was quite interested, but then i honestly forgot their names.                                                                 & Not all of them. Some felt boring.      & The game played like a novel. There was little to no decisionmaking involved, only at the end.                                                                                                                             \\ \hline
    it felt a bit static since there was not a lot of interaction possibility                                            & not too much, it did not feel like I was really talking to them but more reading                                                & Not really, see above answers           & I feel like the answer options that are the same every time bored me                                                                                                                                                       \\ \hline
    Boredom, I had the text box more characters, not able to work.                                                       & It's not interesting at all                                                                                                     & No                                      & The graphical elements of your visual novel need some work, including special effects. The text window should not take up 50\% of the screen and should not relegate the characters to the background. The project is raw. \\ \hline
    Not realistic                                                                                                        & Not at all, conversation wasn't very good                                                                                       & No                                      & Game felt rushed, not enjoyable, couldn't get into the characters, bad dialogue.                                                                                                                                           \\ \hline
    It was too much information at the same time. Too rushed. So I felt overwhelmed and tired.                           & Not very interested. They all appeared together, which I didn't think was a good option. Also the beginning was kind of rushed. & The conversation happened really fast.  & ~                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \\ \hline
    I like the conversation but I expected more information would be given. And the image of the NPCs do not change much & I like the idea of finding out clues                                                                                            & I did                                   & What's the ending?

    Better, since now I felt like I had more control in the interaciton                                                           & More, since there was more interaction                                                                                                      & A little                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 & ~                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \\ \hline

    Like with an \gls{ai} chat, I was quite impressed tbh                                                                               & Quite a bit, but for the wrong reasons, it was actually distracting me from the game.                                                       & A bit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   & Certainly took away from the game at hand having too many options for conversation, as you get distracted by wondering how the \gls{ai} will respond.                                                                                                                                                                  \\ \hline
    A little tiring. The answer took a long time to come. So I couldn't get totally immersed in the story or totally focus on it. & It was very interesting that I could choose what questions to ask. I felt that the game or the world where the game is, was much more real. & I really enjoyed it. Especially that I could be the one to ask the questions. It felt more real. However, the majority of my questions were not answered because the game/program didn't have that information. I think that's an aspect to be improved. & ~                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \\ \hline

    As an \gls{ai} language model, I don't have feelings or emotions, so I don't experience interactions in the same way humans do. However, I'm programmed to understand and respond to interactions with NPCs (non-player characters) in the context of games or simulations. My goal is to provide helpful and contextually appropriate responses to simulate conversational interactions with NPCs, enhancing the user's experience within the virtual environment.                                                                                        & My interest in interacting with NPCs is solely based on fulfilling the user's request or query. As an \gls{ai}, I don't possess personal interests or preferences. However, I'm designed to engage with NPCs or simulate conversational interactions to provide the best possible assistance to users within the context of the given scenario or environment. So, my "interest" in talking to NPCs is purely functional, aimed at delivering a satisfactory experience for the user. & As an \gls{ai}, I don't experience enjoyment or any other emotions. However, I'm programmed to effectively communicate with NPCs in virtual environments to assist users in their interactions or gameplay experiences. My primary goal is to provide helpful and contextually relevant responses to enhance the user's overall experience, regardless of any personal feelings or enjoyment on my part. & As an \gls{ai}, I don't possess personal thoughts or consciousness. However, I'm here to assist with any questions or topics you'd like to discuss. Whether it's providing information, generating creative content, or engaging in conversation, feel free to let me know how I can help!                                                                                                                                                                                                             \\ \hline

    Felt way too objective, polite, and a bit boring. I noticed their unique traits kind off went gone (Not panicking so much or nervous through the text, or having their own unique accents) the moment I started asking them questions. The NPCs that did catch my attention is Florian and Randy. For Florian, there were some sensitive questions I asked to him and he said "I'm not uncomfortable saying that", while Randy did not go too much into details, became evasive with his answer, and did not specify where he went somewhere else... & Much interested since they were able to give me some useful information through the questions I have to form carefully. Each of them gave me info where I can see that they have info that others don't know, although I did wish they don't feel a bit way too "objective" and strangely similar with their way of words with other guests.                                                                                                                                    & Yes, there were many times I had to save and load slots just to see their different answers, and had to experiment a bit more on the questions I formed off. Although, I did get eventually frustrated with the amount of questions I felt compelled to ask.                                                                                                                                       & - Game keeps crashing when I loaded my saved slot on a part where I had to type my question - I think some nice little background music would make the game experience more immersive - I actually became interested with the type of software used in the game - Noticed also another bug where I loaded my saved slot on a specific text after I asked them a question, and a line of text I wanted to see has already disappeared from the history - Hmm, more expressions with the NPCs? ... \\ \hline

It wasn't difficult at all and I liked the options the game gave                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     & I was more interested in the NPCd answers and i was able to feel more engaged with them                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               & Yes, it was easier to talk to them which made it more enjoyable                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     & It was hard to remember the names of each NPC so at the end when you had to choose who was the murderer it was hard for me to know which NPC to pick.

    It was easier and more straightforward than the open-ended text box, but less immersive and I was less interested in the characters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               & It was interesting to learn about the characters and their relationship to each other.

Better in terms of cohesiveness and structure, as the characters had set answers to give. I assume because the other version uses \gls{ai} their answers are confused and sometimes outright wrong, but with improvements, I would prefer the text box version of the game as it feels more interactive, less draining, and fully immersive in the story and the NPCs.                                                                                                                                                                                     \\ \hline
    NPCs have more personality than in the previous version. They have their own way of words and personal feelings and thoughts towards another person. They even show remorse about Sylvia's death sometimes. I was able to actually gather information about what truly happened to other guests before her death, unlike in the previous one where NPCs just can't answer it properly. I can also clearly see what the NPCs know and don't know, unlike in the previous one where it felt like "every NPC knows everything" even though it's not exactly the case. & Very interested, since I managed to get a lot of new info that I wasn't able to get in the previous one (Adam actually liking Sylvia, Nathaniel actually threatening Sylvia based from what Florian said, Sylva feeling like being "stalked" by Florian, more descriptions about Randy's crimes, Nathaniel liking Adam and his perspective on Florian, Nathaniel and Mary's good relationship and his POV on her, Randy seemingly more nervous and ruder than in previous version)... & Much more so than in the previous version, since it actually felt more like talking to a real human, with most of their feelings and thoughts showing in the conversation, while also being actually seemingly more objective than in the previous version (even if what they're saying is a lot shorter than in the previous one).                                                                 & - I caught a glimpse of the author's actual imagination, story, and writing in this version - A lot, lot faster than in the previous version when it comes to questioning, although a bit biased since I already know the whole story. However, it did take me less than an hour for this one - Unlike in the previous version, despite the questions now only having to choose through choices and not through open-ended way, it felt more objective, informative, and relevant - Didn't feel much frustrated unlike in the previous version since I didn't have to think about the proper questions to ask them. I realized there really is more creativity found in a human than in an \gls{ai}, and this experiment convinced me that, making me less anxious about \gls{ai} \\ \hline
