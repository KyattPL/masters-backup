Here are a few additional insights based on the code:

1. The questionnaire responses are stored in columns 7 to 44 (7:45) in both datasets.
2. The 'condition' variable represents the different questionnaire items or questions.
3. The 'score' variable represents the responses or scores for each questionnaire item.
4. The 'order' variable is a between-subjects factor with two levels: 'non-AI first' and 'AI first'. This suggests that there were two groups of participants, one group answered the non-AI questions first, and the other group answered the AI questions first.
5. The 'Sygnatura czasowa' variable is likely a unique identifier for each participant, and it is modified to make the subject IDs unique across the two groups ('_A' and '_B' are appended).
6. The mixed_anova function from the pygler library is used to perform the mixed-design ANOVA, with 'score' as the dependent variable, 'Sygnatura czasowa' as the subject identifier (for repeated measures), 'condition' as the within-subjects factor, and 'order' as the between-subjects factor.

With this additional context, the interpretation of the results would be as follows:

1. The significant effect of the 'condition' factor indicates that there are significant differences in the scores (responses) among the different questionnaire items or questions.
2. The non-significant effect of the 'order' factor suggests that there is no significant difference in the overall scores between the two groups of participants (those who answered non-AI questions first and those who answered AI questions first).
3. The non-significant interaction effect means that the differences in scores among the questionnaire items do not depend on the order in which the participants answered the questions (AI first or non-AI first).

It's worth noting that the mixed-design ANOVA assumes sphericity (homogeneity of variances) for the within-subjects factor. If this assumption is violated, you may need to apply corrections (e.g., Greenhouse-Geisser or Huynh-Feldt) to the degrees of freedom and p-values for the within-subjects and interaction effects.
