I had more to say when interacting with the NPC's. It felt nice to really talk to them and try to get more information.,I was actually interested.,Yes I did.,The game felt quite real. 
"Better, since now I felt like I had more control in the interaciton","More, since there was more interaction",A little,
Скуку,"Ни капли, полный 0",Нет,"От перестановки слагаемых, то есть запикселированых картинок, интереснее играть не стало."
"Like with an AI chat, I was quite impressed tbh","Quite a bit, but for the wrong reasons, it was actually distracting me from the game.",A bit.,"Certainly took away from the game at hand having too many options for conversation, as you get distracted by wondering how the AI will respond."
A little tiring. The answer took a long time to come. So I couldn't get totally immersed in the story or totally focus on it. ,"It was very interesting that I could choose what questions to ask. I felt that the game or the world where the game is, was much more real.","I really enjoyed it. Especially that I could be the one to ask the questions. It felt more real. However, the majority of my questions were not answered because the game/program didn't have that information. I think that's an aspect to be improved.",
More room in exploring more answers,"It was interested, but i wish there is a list of characters somewhere because i kept forgeting their names",I did,"An error occured in the middle, and it would be better to do a between-subject design instead of a within subject design. The same participants already knows the plot from the first version, which may decrease their interst in the second one, even the second one provide a little bit different functions."
