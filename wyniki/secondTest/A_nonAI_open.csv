How did you feel interacting with NPCs?,How interested were you in talking to NPCs?,Did you enjoy talking to NPCs?,Other thoughts
It felt like reading a novel. The game left no room for my own decisions when talking to the NPC's.,"I was quite interested, but then i honestly forgot their names.",Not all of them. Some felt boring.,"The game played like a novel. There was little to no decisionmaking involved, only at the end."
it felt a bit static since there was not a lot of interaction possibility,"not too much, it did not feel like I was really talking to them but more reading","Not really, see above answers",I feel like the answer options that are the same every time bored me
"Скуку, у меня текстовое окно больше персонажей было, не до Делано. ",От слова совсем не интересно,Нет,"Графические элементы вашей визуальной новеллы нуждаются в доработке, включая спецэффектов. Текстовое окно не  должно занимать 50% экрана и не должно отодвигает персонажей на 2 план. Проект сырой. "
Not realistic ,"Not at all, conversation wasn't very good ",No,"Game felt rushed, not enjoyable, couldn't get into the characters, bad dialogue."
It was too much information at the same time. Too rushed. So I felt overwhelmed and tired.,"Not very interested. They all appeared together, which I didn't think was a good option. Also the beginning was kind of rushed.",The conversation happened really fast.,
I like the conversation but I expected more information would be given. And the image of the NPCs do not change much,I like the idea of finding out clues,I did,What's the ending? It's not clear to me!
Great,Not bad,Maybe,"NPCs should help you with tasks
"

There was enough depth to feel like they were somwhat real but still not to much info so i got bored,it started out tedious but then became more interesting,after awhile,
