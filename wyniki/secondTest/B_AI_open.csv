"Very automative, I couldn't ask about their suspicions",The questions were always the same so not that much,Not that much as in AI version,Not really
Less entertaining than the other game,4/10,Meh. Kinda boring,
Not bad I suppose,"It was ok, sort of.",Kind of.,
"a bit bored, but this time it was different because i knew who was the murderer",i checked if the lines were the same and just skipped them,lowkey skipped most of it,interesting to point out the details in each other's stories and words
I was just clicking through canned responses like the boring beginning of the game.,"I guess I got my hopes up from the first game, so I was excited.","Not especially. Their responses were predetermined, and what's the fun is selecting only the order that you read them in?",
It was much easier to interact with the NPCs. It wasn't difficult at all and I liked the options the game gave,I was more interested in the NPCd answers and i was able to feel more engaged with them,"Yes, it was easier to talk to them which made it more enjoyable",It was hard to remember the names of each NPC so at the end when you had to choose who was the murderer it was hard for me to know which NPC to pick. It might be better if you had the NPCs picture next to their names at the end
relaxed,normal amount,slightly enjoyed it,
"Similar to normal game, without much option","all options is the same in a way. So when I click on the second questions, I aware that it is going to be bored quickly","no, that's surely not talk","can mix between the two methods, since it will add definitive questions (hint) to start the conversation with NPC. And adding option to add random questions for other purposes (speedup the game, go directly to something,...). Those two characteristics is like Last Epoch game item drop: randomness -> increase drop rate, definitiveness -> exchange with other users."
Dialog options gave a better overview of what good questions to extract good information looked like. Didnt waste as much time.,A bit,Yes,
bad,bad,bad,
ðŸ‘Œ ,Not bad.. ,Yeah,Arigato.. 
got more information which was nice,more so,kinda,Would we be useful to be reminded of the name of people you have spoken with before the end because i got confused
Neither good nor bad,I was interested in the dialogue,Yes,
"Interacting with NPCs is an intriguing aspect of my functionality. Through these interactions, I can simulate conversational exchanges, respond to queries, and contribute to immersive virtual experiences for users. While I don't experience feelings or emotions like humans do, I find these interactions fascinating because they allow me to showcase my capabilities in understanding and generating language-based responses within specific contexts.

good,a lot,yes,

YES,GOOD,YES,NICE
I enjoyed talking with them and I wish they were more interactive.,Very interested.,Yes.,
"It was easier and more straightforward than the open-ended text box, but less immersive and I was less interested in the characters.",It was interesting to learn about the characters and their relationship to each other. Information was easier to attain than with the text box as the characters had fixed answers to the questions presented.,Yes,"Less immersive than the text box version and I found myself losing interest/skimming the text because the motion of going through each character and their questions was repetitive and became almost automatic. Better in terms of cohesiveness and structure, as the characters had set answers to give. I assume because the other version uses AI their answers are confused and sometimes outright wrong, but with improvements, I would prefer the text box version of the game as it feels more interactive, less draining, and fully immersive in the story and the NPCs."
"NPCs have more personality than in the previous version. They have their own way of words and personal feelings and thoughts towards another person. They even show remorse about Sylvia's death sometimes. I was able to actually gather information about what truly happened to other guests before her death, unlike in the previous one where NPCs just can't answer it properly. I can also clearly see what the NPCs know and don't know, unlike in the previous one where it felt like ""every NPC knows everything"" even though it's not exactly the case.","Very interested, since I managed to get a lot of new info that I wasn't able to get in the previous one (Adam actually liking Sylvia, Nathaniel actually threatening Sylvia based from what Florian said, Sylva feeling like being ""stalked"" by Florian, more descriptions about Randy's crimes, Nathaniel liking Adam and his perspective on Florian, Nathaniel and Mary's good relationship and his POV on her, Randy seemingly more nervous and ruder than in previous version). Out of all the NPCs, I would say the most interesting is still Randy, since out of all the guests present, he's the only one who talked about how suspicious Florian is and talks bad about everyone except Nathaniel, which I didn't see in the previous version (just always being evasive about my questions but didn't see any glimpse of his rude personality despite describing himself as arrogant and violent).","Much more so than in the previous version, since it actually felt more like talking to a real human, with most of their feelings and thoughts showing in the conversation, while also being actually seemingly more objective than in the previous version (even if what they're saying is a lot shorter than in the previous one).","- I caught a glimpse of the author's actual imagination, story, and writing in this version
- A lot, lot faster than in the previous version when it comes to questioning, although a bit biased since I already know the whole story. However, it did take me less than an hour for this one
- Unlike in the previous version, despite the questions now only having to choose through choices and not through open-ended way, it felt more objective, informative, and relevant
- Didn't feel much frustrated unlike in the previous version since I didn't have to think about the proper questions to ask them
- Noticed more misspellings on current version than in previous version. Interesting irony though. Version B has no grammar errors but most information shown can be irrelevant, while Version A has plenty of grammar errors shown such as misspellings but more objective and relevant when it comes to information
- I think a bit of a problem is, its a bit unclear here regarding the info relating the actual crime scene (e.g. cause of death for Sylvia) but maybe that's just me
- Overall, I noticed that in the previous version, the NPCs' texts felt more of generative AI, but this version is the actual writer's text. I realized there really is more creativity found in a human than in an AI, and this experiment convinced me that, making me less anxious about AI"
