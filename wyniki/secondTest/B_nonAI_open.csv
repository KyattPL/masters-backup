How did you feel interacting with NPCs?,How interested were you in talking to NPCs?,Did you enjoy talking to NPCs?,Other thoughts
"It was really nice, I could ask whatever I wanted",Very interested,I did,Sometimes it was hard to come up with questions. Especially that I could ask 10 of them per NPC
It was interesting to see I could ask anything and they'd reply.,7/10???,Yes,
weren't very interesting,not much really,not really,
"bored, they all seem to have the similar style of communication
","not realy, i wanted to get to the bottom of this and see if i can guess the murderer",i disliked the NPCs that said lots of bad things about others. i think it's what made me suspect the murderer the most and it's a nice touch on the author's part,looks like this game was quickly made specfically for an assignment. not too bad
"It was great! Except for a couple of ""not enough previous conversation history"" messages, they were indistinguishable from real players.","At first, the game was kind of boring, and I was surprised when asked to ask ANY 10 questions. I thought for sure that the canned responses wouldn't be able to handle that. But the NPCs talked just like real players.",Yep! They offered helpful responses to most of my questions.,"I believe this is an experiment about LLMs, which I wholeheartedly support!"
It was easy to get to know the NPCs personalities and interacting with them was interesting and engaging,"I liked talking to them, it was fun and engaging","Yes, it was enjoyable",The game did bug and it was difficult to interact with them by typing in your own responses. I didn't mind the automatic responses the game gave. Trying to put in your own responses was the least enjoyable for me because of this
relaxed,little bit,not really,
"surprise that NPC understand my random questions, and intention","not that interesting if you considered this is just a text-based game (similar to chatGPT), should have NPC emotion, change in the assets....","the first few questions, yes. Furthermore, I am not so sure",
The variety in their characters was a little to small. Their responses were very similar which is obvious if got was used. They were all not very helpful.,A little,Yes,
nbad,bad,bnad,
Great..,Not bad...,Yeah,Arigato.. 
Frustrated,Not at all,No,the replies are not detailed enough
"I felt nothing special, neither good nor bad. I was just listening to them",I was interested in their story,I enjoyed it,
"As an AI language model, I don't have feelings or emotions, so I don't experience interactions in the same way humans do. However, I'm programmed to understand and respond to interactions with NPCs (non-player characters) in the context of games or simulations. My goal is to provide helpful and contextually appropriate responses to simulate conversational interactions with NPCs, enhancing the user's experience within the virtual environment.



","My interest in interacting with NPCs is solely based on fulfilling the user's request or query. As an AI, I don't possess personal interests or preferences. However, I'm designed to engage with NPCs or simulate conversational interactions to provide the best possible assistance to users within the context of the given scenario or environment. So, my ""interest"" in talking to NPCs is purely functional, aimed at delivering a satisfactory experience for the user.



","As an AI, I don't experience enjoyment or any other emotions. However, I'm programmed to effectively communicate with NPCs in virtual environments to assist users in their interactions or gameplay experiences. My primary goal is to provide helpful and contextually relevant responses to enhance the user's overall experience, regardless of any personal feelings or enjoyment on my part.



","As an AI, I don't possess personal thoughts or consciousness. However, I'm here to assist with any questions or topics you'd like to discuss. Whether it's providing information, generating creative content, or engaging in conversation, feel free to let me know how I can help!

GREAT,a lot,yes,
GOOD,YES,GOOD,NICE

"They were only there to provide information, but I always wanted them to be more interactive.",Very interested.,Yes.,
"It was interesting to talk to them and be able to compose your own messages, questions, and comments, and it was a more immersive gaming experience than I am used to narrative-wise.","Quite interested. The NPCs had unique backstories and personalities, although they seemed a bit confused sometimes",Yes,"NPCs were a bit confused at times and gave wrong information, mixing up other characters (e.g., Mary and Sylvia) and sometimes repeated themselves."
"Felt way too objective, polite, and a bit boring. I noticed their unique traits kind off went gone (Not panicking so much or nervous through the text, or having their own unique accents) the moment I started asking them questions. The NPCs that did catch my attention is Florian and Randy. For Florian, there were some sensitive questions I asked to him and he said ""I'm not uncomfortable saying that"", while Randy did not go too much into details, became evasive with his answer, and did not specify where he went somewhere else. The other times I did find something interesting is either when they were able to give me some useful information, or something was off with the line of information (Mary saying Sylvia is not a criminal investigator but Randy said she is also a detective).","Much interested since they were able to give me some useful information through the questions I have to form carefully. Each of them gave me info where I can see that they have info that others don't know, although I did wish they don't feel a bit way too ""objective"" and strangely similar with their way of words with other guests.","Yes, there were many times I had to save and load slots just to see their different answers, and had to experiment a bit more on the questions I formed off. Although, I did get eventually frustrated with the amount of questions I felt compelled to ask.","- Game keeps crashing when I loaded my saved slot on a part where I had to type my question
- I think some nice little background music would make the game experience more immersive
- I actually became interested with the type of software used in the game
- Noticed also another bug where I loaded my saved slot on a specific text after I asked them a question, and a line of text I wanted to see has already disappeared from the history
- Hmm, more expressions with the NPCs?
- I wish the ending was more interesting, such as the police now going to the villa and interrogating each of the guests, which then eventually reveals who is the real murderer. Can also add guests' reactions about the accusation
- Felt way too longer than usual while I was playing. Maybe I got affected by the max amount of questions I had to ask (Compelled to ask ""all"" possible questions)
- Overall, even if this is just some experiment, the game is very interesting since this is my first time to play a game where I had to type a question I formed myself and the NPC actually answers it without being ""way too off"" about the context of the game"
